# Climate-analysis
A python based project to find the climate patterns and future temperature prediction using machine learning algorithms

collect the dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis:
      Shape of the data
      Dataset information
      Describe the data
      Handle the Null values
      Handle the missing values
      Handle the duplicate values
      Check the unique vales
      Detect the outliers
      
Correlation between the features.
Visualize the Climate patterns
     Pie Chart-> weather_condition, wind_direction, location, land_use_type
     Bar Chart-> Count the Weather Records by Top Countries
     KMeans Clustering for visualizing the Temperature and Humidity
     Geographical Distribution of Locations by Country Temperature
     Treemap of Average Humidity and Air Quality by Country
     Distribution of Weather Data Columns
     
 Highest recorded wind speed according to this Dataset
 
 Highest recorded Co2, Methane, Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozon level according to this Dataset
 
 Maximum and Minimum temperature recorded for locations according to this Dataset
 
 Label Encoding to convert the categoriacl features into numerical features
 
 Feature Importance for model accuracy
 
 Model selcetion and Prediction:
     Linear Regression
     Random Forest Regresssor
     Predict the Future temperature
